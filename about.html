	<h1>About</h1>

	<p> Hi! I'm Abby, and welcome to my baking business. I Love to bake so I created abbycatebakes to show the world what I can do.</p>

	<p>I live in Boulder, Colorado. I have helped out in the kitchen sense I was 4 and when I was 10 I started baking on my own. I have always wanted to start a baking business now I am 13 and my dreams are coming true. My favortive thing about baking is geting to be creative when your decorating your treats and geting to experement with difrent flavors and techniques.</p>

	<p> I am a super active person so when I am not baking I play sprots and climb. I was in gymnastics for 5 years of my life so I just naturally do cartwheels and backbends all around my kitchen. Now I dont do gymnastics but instead I go to climbing and I love it.</p>
